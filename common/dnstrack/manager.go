// Package dnstrack is the lx DNS-query observability layer (SPEC 018). It mirrors
// common/trafficcontrol for DNS: a process-attributed, structured live stream of DNS
// resolutions that the command server exposes as SubscribeDNSQueries.
//
// Why it exists: hijacked DNS (the norm on an Android VPN) is answered in
// route.hijackDNSStream/Packet BEFORE a connection becomes a trafficcontrol tracker, so
// DNS queries never appear in the connections stream. The only existing egress was the
// text log (dns/client_log.go), which carries no ProcessInfo — forcing LxBox to parse
// log lines and stitch package names by conn_id. This package emits the same data
// structurally, attributed in the core where ProcessInfo is already on the context.
