### Fields

#### outbounds

==Required==

List of outbound tags to test.

#### url

The URL to test. `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` will be used if empty.

#### interval

The test interval. `3m` will be used if empty.

#### tolerance

The test tolerance in milliseconds. `50` will be used if empty.

#### idle_timeout

The idle timeout. `30m` will be used if empty.

#### interrupt_exist_connections

Interrupt existing connections when the selected outbound has changed.

Only inbound connections are affected by this setting, internal connections will always be interrupted.

#### mode

!!! quote "sing-box-lx"

    An `lx` extension (SPEC 019, SPEC 116), not present in upstream sing-box.

Load-balancing mode — how a node is chosen per connection:

- `least_test` (default, also when empty): pick the lowest-delay node. This is upstream's
  behaviour; `balancer` must not be set.
- `round_robin`: rotate over a fixed-size **pool** of nodes (see `balancer`). Selection
  happens once per connection; a UDP/QUIC session stays on one node. Designed to scale to
  large node lists — only the pool is health-checked, not every node.
- `failover` (SPEC 116): pick the lowest-delay node and **hold it until it fails**, even if
  another node becomes faster. Each `interval` only the held node is tested. When it fails
  a test, or a dial through it fails with a "path is dead" error, the group moves to the
  lowest-delay live node and holds that one. A manual URL test tests every node and
  re-selects the fastest. `tolerance` is ignored (a startup warning says so); `balancer`
  must not be set.

`least_connection` was considered and dropped (`round_robin` is statistically even).

#### balancer

!!! quote "sing-box-lx"

    An `lx` extension (SPEC 019), not present in upstream sing-box.

`round_robin` parameters. Only valid with `mode: round_robin` (an error otherwise); when
omitted, defaults apply. The upstream `tolerance` field is **ignored** in `round_robin` (a
warning is logged) — use `pool_tolerance` instead.

##### balancer.pool

The rotation pool size — how many nodes are in rotation at once. `0` or omitted uses the
default `3`; a negative value is an error. The effective size is
`min(pool, number of outbounds)`. Only the pool is health-checked each interval, so a list
of hundreds/thousands of nodes does not mean hundreds/thousands of URL tests.

##### balancer.pool_tolerance

In milliseconds. Controls how the pool is filled and maintained:

- `0` (default): keep the pool full of **live** nodes, delay is not ranked. The core tests
  no more nodes than needed to refill the pool, then stops — the cheap mode for large lists.
- `> 0`: test all nodes and keep the **fastest** `pool` of them. A pool member is replaced
  only when an outside node beats it by more than `pool_tolerance` ms (hysteresis against
  churn). Testing all nodes is more expensive — suitable for smaller lists.

A dead pool node keeps its slot until a live replacement is found, so the pool never empties.
A dial error never changes the pool (its cause is unknowable from one failure); only the
periodic health-check does.

##### balancer.sticky_hash

Binds one flow to one node, so the same key (e.g. the same destination domain) always
reaches the same pool node. Key components, concatenated in order. **Omitted (or `[]`) →
defaults to `["process", "domain"]`** (stickiness on). To **disable** stickiness (pure
round-robin) use the sentinel **`["none"]`** — a bare `[]` cannot be used because the config
decoder collapses an empty array to "omitted" (see the note below). An absent component
contributes an empty string; when all are empty the key is `""`, which maps to a single fixed
slot (so keyless flows do not rotate). Allowed values:

- `process`: the source process (Android package name, else executable path).
- `domain`: the destination domain from the original (sniffed) request — read from
  `metadata.Domain`, which survives the router's domain→IP resolve, so it is populated
  for normal domain traffic. Only truly empty for raw-IP destinations (no domain to sniff).
- `source_ip`: the source IP.
- `dest_ip`: the destination IP — **empty until the destination is resolved**, so for
  domain-based traffic (socks5h / sniffed) it is `""` when the key is built.
- `dest_port`: the destination port.
- `none`: **disables** stickiness. Must be the only element (mixing it with a real component
  is an error).

!!! note

    `["none"]` rather than `[]` is required to turn stickiness off: the sing-box config decoder
    re-marshals each outbound and an empty JSON array does not survive that round-trip (it
    becomes indistinguishable from an omitted field, which means *default*). The `"none"`
    sentinel is unambiguous.

Binding is to a fixed **slot index** (`slot[hash(key) % pool]`), not a node position. Since
slots never move and a replacement takes the exact slot it evicts, a node that stays in its
slot keeps all its keys when other slots change — no needless reconnects, no per-key state.

!!! note

    For domain-based traffic, `domain` is the natural sticky key and works out of the
    box (it reads the sniffed domain, which survives domain→IP resolution). `dest_ip`
    remains a valid alternative, but note it is `""` until the destination is resolved,
    so a key of only `source_ip` / `dest_ip` / `dest_port` can collapse to one shared
    key for an unresolved destination from a single source — correct stickiness, but
    coarser granularity. For raw-IP destinations (no domain to sniff) use `dest_ip`.

!!! tip

    For a large node list, `mode: round_robin` with `pool_tolerance: 0` and a small `pool`
    (e.g. 3) is the recommended setup: a handful of live nodes in rotation, minimal testing.
    A longer `interval` (e.g. `15m`) further reduces background testing.
